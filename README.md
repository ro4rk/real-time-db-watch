# Real-Time DB Watch

A real-time database watch and event streaming system that monitors changes in MongoDB, denormalizes the data, and streams it to connected clients via Socket.IO. It uses Redis Streams for persistent buffering with token‑based resumption, and a slick, sci‑fi–themed dashboard for displaying live changes.

## Overview

This project implements a real-time monitoring system that detects and displays changes (Create, Update, Delete) in selected MongoDB collections (`movies`, `users`, and `comments`). The changes are denormalized for clarity and routed through Redis Streams (with token‑based resume) before being broadcast to a dynamic, visually engaging dashboard.

Users must log in to access the dashboard. When a user logs in, the system resumes the event stream from the last message the user viewed, ensuring that no events are missed even if the user disconnects and reconnects.

## Features

- **Real-Time Change Detection:** Uses MongoDB Change Streams with the `{ fullDocument: 'updateLookup' }` option to capture complete document updates.
- **Data Denormalization:** Transforms raw change events into human-friendly formats for movies, users, and comments.
- **Redis Streams Integration:** Persists event messages and supports token‑based resumption so users resume where they left off.
- **Socket.IO Communication:** Broadcasts updates to all connected clients instantly.
- **Protected Dashboard:** Only logged-in users can view the dashboard; unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
- **Stylish Frontend:** A sci‑fi themed UI complete with constellations, shooting stars, and orbiting planets.
- **Simulation Script:** A separate script (`triggerChanges.js`) simulates multiple CRUD operations using thematic data (e.g., inspired by *Good Will Hunting* and *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* with a Matrix twist).

## Architecture

The system is composed of three main components:

1. **MongoDB Change Stream:**  
   Listens for changes on selected collections (movies, users, comments) within the `sample_mflix` database. It leverages the `fullDocument: 'updateLookup'` option so that update events include the complete document.

2. **Redis Streams:**  
   Receives denormalized change events (converted to flat, stringified key-value pairs) and stores a persistent stream of events. The user’s last viewed event token is stored using keys such as `user:USERNAME:lastToken`, allowing token‑based resumption.

3. **Socket.IO & Dashboard:**  
   A Node.js server uses Socket.IO to broadcast event updates in real time to a protected dashboard. The frontend dashboard displays events in separate sections for Created, Updated, and Deleted changes and enforces a login redirect for unauthenticated users.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (using Change Streams)
- **Streaming:** Redis Streams
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with a custom sci‑fi design)
- **Environment Management:** dotenv

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-db-watch.git
   cd real-time-db-watch
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` File:**  
   In the root directory create a file named `.env` and add your configuration:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   REDIS_URL=redis://default:your_redis_password@your_redis_host:your_redis_port
   ```

4. **Set Up Redis:**  
   - If using a local Redis instance, ensure it's running (e.g., `redis-server`).
   - If using a cloud Redis instance, verify the credentials in your `.env` file.

5. **(Optional) Run in Development Mode with `concurrently`:**

   Install concurrently:

   ```bash
   npm install -g concurrently
   ```

   Then add to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "concurrently \"node server.js\" \"node triggerChanges.js\""
   }
   ```

   Run with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Server:**

   In one terminal, run:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Simulate Changes:** ## this has been used so that we can demonstrate some rapid events in a db.

   In another terminal, run the simulation script:

   ```bash
   node triggerChanges.js
   ```

3. **Access the Dashboard:**

   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
   - Unauthenticated users will be redirected to `login.html`.
   - Log in using the credentials provided in `login.html` (e.g., username: `admin`, password: `1234`).
   - Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to `dashboard` (which serves `index.html`), where you'll see real-time updates in the "Created Changes," "Updated Changes," and "Deleted Changes" sections.

```

## Demo

When you run the server and simulation script, you should see:

- **Console Logs:** Real-time logs of changes detected in MongoDB, Redis stream operations, and Socket.IO connections.
- **Dashboard UI:** Dynamic sections for "Created Changes," "Updated Changes," and "Deleted Changes" populated in real time.
- **Visual Effects:** A constellation canvas, shooting stars, and orbiting planets that reinforce the sci‑fi theme.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Authentication:** Upgrade to backend-based authentication (using JWT or session cookies) instead of relying solely on sessionStorage.
- **Enhanced Filtering:** Add options for filtering events by collection or operation type.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Build an analytics view for querying historical event data.
- **Deployment:** Dockerize and deploy the application on a cloud provider such as AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
